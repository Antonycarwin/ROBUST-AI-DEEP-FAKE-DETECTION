# ROBUST-AI-DEEP-FAKE-DETECTION
This project focuses on detecting audio deepfakes using a lightweight and interpretable machine learning approach. It utilizes MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) for extracting relevant features from audio files and applies the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification.
